#Getting started with examples

= Introduction =
After you downloaded the Screencompare-package, you'll have three folders:
 * *lib*: Contains the "screencompare.jar" plus all other required jars (Selenium, JUnit, iText, ...)
 * *data*: Output like screenshots and pdf-reports will be stored here
 * *examples*: Example tests, some of which are described on this page

You'll also see the following scripts for easy test-running from the command line:
 * *startSelenium.sh/bat*: Start the Selenium server which is needed for almost all tests
 * *runExample.sh/bat*: Run one of the example tests

= Examples =
The Selenium-server needs to be running for these tests, you can start it from a terminal with the included script:

Mac OS X: {{{./startSelenium.sh}}}<br/>
Windows: {{{startSelenium.bat}}}

Then start the test case in a second terminal by specifying an example's name as parameter for "runExample.sh", eg:

Mac OS X: {{{./runExample.sh ScreenshotsMacTest}}}<br/>
Windows: {{{runExample.bat ScreenshotsMacTest}}}

== !ScreenshotsWinTest ==
We'll start by executing a basic test-case which opens a webpage in various browsers and saves the screenshots to disk.
{{{
import screencompare.*;
import screencompare.browser.*;
import screencompare.screen.*;

public class ScreenshotsWinTest extends ScreencompareTestCase {

	public void test() throws Exception {
		Browser[] browsers = { Browser.FIREFOX, Browser.IE, Browser.CHROME };

		for (Browser browser : browsers) {
			start("http://www.google.ch", browser);
			captureScreen().save();
			stop();
		}
	}

}
}}}
This will result in three screenshots from the different browsers in your "data/screens/" folder.

== CompareFirefoxIETest ==
This will open two sites in Firefox and IE. The resulting screenshots are compared by _verifySame()_. A threshold of 0.05 is passed along, so 5% of the pixels may differ for the test to succeed.
{{{
import screencompare.*;
import screencompare.browser.*;
import screencompare.screen.*;

public class CompareFirefoxIETest extends ScreencompareTestCase {

	public void test() throws Exception {
		String[] urls = {"http://www.google.ch",
						"http://weatherflash.com/"};

		for (String url:urls) {
			start(url, Browser.FIREFOX);
			Screen firefox = captureScreen();
			stop();
			
			start(url, Browser.IE);
			Screen ie = captureScreen();
			stop();
			
			verifySame(firefox, ie, 0.05f, Alignment.TOP_CENTER);
		}
	}

}
}}}
In this case both visited webpages differ more than 5% in IE6 and Firefox. A PDF-report for each page is created in your "data/reports/"-folder. You can take a look at an example report [http://www.retokaiser.com/Projects/screencompare/report_CompareFirefoxIETest.pdf here].
