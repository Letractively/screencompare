#Getting started with examples

= Introduction =
After you downloaded the Screencompare-package, you'll have three folders:
 * *lib*: Contains the "screencompare.jar" plus all other required jars (Selenium, JUnit, iText, ...)
 * *data*: Output like screenshots and pdf-reports will be stored here
 * *examples*: Example tests, some of which are described on this page

You'll also see the following scripts for easy test-running from the command line:
* *startSelenium.sh/bat*: Start the Selenium server which is needed for almost all tests
* *runExample.sh/bat*: Run one of the example tests (specify its name as the only parameter!)

In the following examples I'm assuming you're using Mac OS X. If you're using Windows, just run the ".bat" instead of the ".sh" files.
You'll need the JDK and the involved browsers installed.

== ScreenshotsMacTest/ScreenshotsWinTest ==
We'll start by executing a basic test-case which opens a webpage in various browsers and saves the screenshots to disk.

Start the selenium server in a terminal:
{{{
./startSelenium.sh
}}}
Start the test case in a second terminal:
{{{
./runExample.sh ScreenshotsMacTest
}}}
